# Machine Learning Templates
This directory contains the all the implementation of the Machine Learning Algorithms with Feature Engineering and Data Visualisations.
There are some steps to be followed before implementing the ML Algorithms.
```
Data Analysis -> Data Visualisation -> Feature Engineering -> ML Algorithms Implementation -> Optimizational Process [Optional] -> Output
```

Here the Optimizational Process is optional because the Machine Learning Algorithms is optimized by the Gradient Descent and by minimizing the prediction equation through the Loss Function.
Not all the ML Algorithms are optimized by loss functions and Gradient Descent, however they are optimized by these rules only.

Proper answer for the Optimizational Process of ML Algorithms with loss function and gradient descents?
Yes, most Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are optimized using loss functions and optimization techniques like gradient descent. 
These tools are fundamental to training many types of ML models, particularly in supervised learning, to minimize prediction errors and improve model performance.
